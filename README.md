# Adventure
This was a short CRPG based off many roguelikes such as dwarf fortress, Cataclysm, and Liberal Crime Squad. I've worked on and off on it since 2016. I've mostly stopped working on it to instead focus on my upcoming game Artifical https://twoshoesdigitalmedia.com/ <br />

The Game features: 
1) A randomly generated world with forests and cities. Buildings and objects in these worldspaces are also randomly placed with random NPCS and items. A Map updates as you visit these locations
2) A primitive character customization system where you can select your background and stats
3) A primitive combat system to fight monsters and collect their loot
4) An equipment and inventory system with consumables and books
5) A threaded day/night system 
6) Buy and sell items to NPCs.
7) Resolution options and settings <br>
Planned additions:
7) Quest System
8) Magic
9) Dungeons
